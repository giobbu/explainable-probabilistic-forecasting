# Probabilistic Forecasting with Attention Weights
##  Representing Uncertainty using Probability Density Functions
From an information theory perspective, the probability density function (*pdf*) contains all the information associated with a random variable. The *pdf* representation provides the full probability distributions. From the *pdf* the decision maker can decide which uncertainty form of representation is best suited for the problem at hand.
